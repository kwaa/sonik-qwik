# sonik-qwik

## Slow Start

Currently, it requires a local link to the latest `sonik` (include [sonikjs/sonik#13](https://github.com/sonikjs/sonik/pull/13) and manually update hono in devDeps to the latest)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwaa/sonik-qwik.git
cd sonik-qwik
pnpm install
pnpm link ../sonik # Your local sonik needs to install the dependencies via yarn v1... yes, it's painful.
pnpm dev # run!
```
